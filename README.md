The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model and implement it as a user-friendly online application that can deliver reliable predictions about the resale values of Singapore apartments. This prediction model will be based on previous transactions involving resale flats, with the purpose of assisting future buyers and sellers in determining the value of a flat after it has been previously resold. Many factors influence resale values, including location, kind of apartment, total square footage, and lease period. One way a predictive model can help overcome these challenges is by providing clients with a projected resale price based on these parameters.
